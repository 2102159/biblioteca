        <p>“Society is very complex, and it is becoming more and more complicated. 
            And the collective capacity of people to deal with this increasingly complex reality is not growing, to the point that there may come a time when it completely overwhelms us, 
            that the institutions we have cannot face the changes with the speed and capacity necessary.” <spam>By Douglas Carl Engelbart </spam> </p>
