                <h3>A Bit Of History</h3>
                <p>Hundreds of years ago, Playa del Carmen was an important Mayan stop along the pilgrimage route toward
                    the nearby island of Cozumel, considered a sacred place at the time.
                </p>

                <p>What we now call Playa del Carmen was once known as “Xaman-Ha,” which in Mayan means “waters of the
                    north”
                </p>

                <p>Over the years, Playa, as it is commonly known, became a vital city of commerce and trade. Due to the
                    frequency of pilgrims, trade seekers, pirates and European explorers, the city flourished.

                <h3>Playa Del Carmen Today</h3>
                <p>Today, travelers and locals visit the city for relaxation, nature, culture and a less expensive but
                    no less beautiful travel destination than Cancun. Playa is said to be one of the fastest-growing
                    cities in Latin America and is the jumping off point for the scuba and snorkeling destination of
                    Cozumel.

                <h3>Is Playa Del Carmen Safe?</h3>
                <p>Playa Del Carmen is a generally safe destination for traveling in Mexico. Due to the large tourism
                    scene and a high number of travelers, petty theft and scams aren’t uncommon but aren’t a huge threat
                    either.
                </p>

                <p>It is wise to keep a close eye on your belongings and don’t leave your valuables unattended,
                    including drinks and beverages, as it is a large party town. While drug cartels are present,
                    tourists are not the target.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, Playa Del Carman is statistically one of the safest towns in Quintana Roo.</p>

                <h2>Where is Playa Del Carmen?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Playa del Carmen is located on the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on the Caribbean
                        seashore. Located in the heart of the Riviera Maya coastal area, Playa del Carmen is almost
                        exactly in the middle between the cities of Cancun and Tulum, just about 35 miles from each.</p>
                    <p>Playa del Carmen is also the jumping off point for Cozumel island, with ferries departing every
                        hour.</p>

                    <h3>January – April</h3>
                    <p>The tropical climate in Playa Del Carmen is fairly predictable and easy to make plans around.
                        Without much of a temperature difference throughout the year, (the average temperature lingers
                        around 83° F) it’s the rainy season that visitors should pay attention to.
                    </p>

                    <p>The weather is picture perfect, but “peak season” means lots of tourists and higher prices. The
                        ocean, cenotes and swimming pools (that aren’t heated) can still be a little chilly for some.

                    <h3>May – October</h3>
                    <p>The hottest and most rainy months of the year still offer plenty of wonderful sunshine and
                        fantastic warm water for snorkeling & diving. The hurricane season peaks in September and
                        October so keep an eye on the forecasts and definitely get travel insurance just in case. Fewer
                        tourists mean fewer crowds and lower rates at hotels, resorts and tour companies during this
                        time.

                    <p>Many consider the autumn-winter months to be the best time to visit Playa del Carmen. The
                        hurricane season has passed by this time, and the humidity is low. It can be a little “cool” in
                        the evenings so bring a warming layer.
