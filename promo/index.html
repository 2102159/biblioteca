            <h2>Starring: Adjoa Andoh, Julie Andrews, Lorraine Ashbourne
                Created By:Chris Van Dusen
            </h2>
            <div class="desc">It is based on historical and romantic fiction novels written by Julia Quinn starring the
                Bridgerton family: "The Duke and I" (2000), "The Viscount Who Loved Me" (2000), "I Give You My Heart" (
                2001), “Seducing Mr. Bridgerton” (2002), “To Sir Phillip, With Love” (2003), “The Heart Of A Bridgerton”
                (2004), “For A Kiss” (2005) and “Looking for a Wife” (2006).
                The series, mixing drama and romance, is set at the time of the English Regency, which runs from 1811 to
                1820 with the reign of George IV after George III, his father, was declared unfit to act as monarch.
                It has the concept of a nineteenth-century soap opera with a high-society atmosphere. Sex is common in
                his episodes.
            </div>

            <div class="desc"> The series is set in London high society during the English Regency period of the 19th
                century. The story focuses on two families, the Bridgertons and the Featheringtons.1

                The Bridgerton family consists of Violet, Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton, her four sons Anthony,
                Benedict, Colin, and Gregory, and her four daughters Daphne, Eloise, Francesca, and Hyacinth.

                The Featherington family consists of Lady Portia Featherington, her husband Baron Archibald
                Featherington and their three daughters, Philippa, Prudence and Penelope, and a distant cousin, Marina
                Thompson.2

                Each season reflects the story of a Bridgerton brother:3 in the first season the story was based on
                Daphne, while the second season corresponds to Anthony.

            <div class="desc">Throughout the Netflix series The Bridgertons, the typical character of the British is
                noted: their acid tone with everything and everyone. There are characters like Lady Danbury (Adjoa
                Andoh) in which their way of being favors this tone as they have no qualms about dropping the truths in
                a veiled way.
                Also, the series is based on the novels by Julia Quinn. The English writer is known for two reasons: the
                love theme of her work and for giving her characters a feminist touch. In the series we will see
                perfectly how Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie), despite being educated for motherhood and knowing how
                to run a house, prefers to dedicate herself to other tasks and does not care if she finds someone to
                marry or not.
            </div>

            <div class="desc">Lady Whistledown is one of the most important pieces in the series. Although she is voiced
                by Julie Andrews, this veteran actress does not interpret her, it is someone from the city who
                masquerades under this name. This mysterious woman has her namesake in the royal history of England.
                Under the name of Mrs. Crackenthorpe, the Female Tatler magazine, which was distributed between 1709 and
                1710, turned London society upside down by uncovering the infidelities of the time.</div>

            <div class="desc">
                The series The Bridgertons of Netflix Season 1 stands out for several reasons. The main one would be the
                performances of the actors, among which Phoebe Dynevor and Regé-Jean Page stand out. Something that is
                complemented by the wonderful soundtrack by Kris Bowers, in charge of transporting us to the ballroom
                dances of the time, and whose strong point is the reinterpretations of current songs on violin, as is
                the case with 'Girls Like You' or 'Bad Guy ' in several episodes.
                As a negative point to say that the rhythm of the series is unbalanced. After an extraordinary first
                four chapters, the following ones decline a bit and until the last one the series does not find the tone
                again. Despite this minor blur, The Bridgertons is a light period series that leaves viewers wanting
                more.</div>
